        "Dhritarashtra said: O Sanjay, after gathering on the holy field of Kurukshetra, and desiring to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?",
        "Sanjay said: O King, after observing the Pandava army arrayed in military formation, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Drona and spoke the following words.",
        "Behold, O teacher, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by the son of Drupada, your wise disciple.",
        "Here in this army are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhima and Arjuna; great fighters like Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada.",
        "There are also great heroic, powerful fighters like Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, and the valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya.",
        "Yudhamanyu and the powerful Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi, all these warriors are great chariot fighters.",
        "But for your information, O best of the Brahmanas, let me tell you about the captains who are especially qualified to lead my military force.",
        "There are personalities like you, Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta called Bhurishrava, who are always victorious in battle.",
        "There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. All of them are well equipped with various kinds of weapons, and all are experienced in military science.",
        "Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bhishma, whereas the strength of the Pandavas, carefully protected by Bhima, is limited.",
        "All of you must now give full support to Grandfather Bhishma, as you stand at your respective strategic points of entrance into the phalanx of the army.",
        "Then Bhishma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly, making a sound like the roar of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy.",
        "After that, the conchshells, drums, bugles, trumpets, and horns were all suddenly sounded, and the combined sound was tumultuous.",
        "On the other side, both Lord Krishna and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.",
        "Lord Krishna blew His conchshell called Panchajanya, Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta, and Bhima, the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell called Paundra.",
        "King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conchshell, the Anantavijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosha and Manipushpaka.",
        "That great archer the King of Kashi, the great fighter Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the unconquerable Satyaki...",
        "Drupada, the sons of Draupadi, and the others, O King, such as the mighty-armed son of Subhadra, all blew their respective conchshells.",
        "The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious, vibrating both in the sky and on the earth. It shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra.",
        "At that time Arjuna, the son of Pandu, seated in the chariot bearing the flag marked with Hanuman, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows, looking at the sons of Dhritarashtra. O King, Arjuna then spoke to Hrishikesha (Krishna).",
        "Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies...",
        "so that I may see those present here, who desire to fight, and with whom I must contend in this great trial of arms.",
        "Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.",
        "Sanjay said: O descendant of Bharata, having thus been addressed by Arjuna, Lord Krishna drew the fine chariot up in the midst of the armies of both parties.",
        "In the presence of Bhishma, Drona, and all the other chieftains of the world, the Lord said, Just behold, Partha, all the Kurus assembled here.",
        "There Arjuna could see, within the midst of the armies of both parties, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends, and also his father-in-law and well-wishers.",
        "When the son of Kunti, Arjuna, saw all these different grades of friends and relatives, he became overwhelmed with compassion and spoke thus.",
        "Arjuna said: My dear Krishna, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up.",
        "My whole body is trembling, my hair is standing on end, my bow Gandiva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.",
        "I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I see only causes of misfortune, O Krishna, killer of the Kesi demon.",
        "I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle.",
        "Nor can I, my dear Krishna, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.",
        "O Govinda, of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness, or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield?",
        "O Madhusudana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me.",
        "Why should I wish to kill them, even though they might otherwise kill me? If we kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, what satisfaction will we derive from the dominion over the three worlds, what to speak of this Earth?",
        "O Maintainer of all living entities, what pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhritarasthra? Even though they may be aggressors, sin will certainly come upon us if we slay them.",
        "Hence, it does not behoove us to kill our own cousins, the sons of Dhritarashtra, and friends. O Madhav (Krishna), how can we hope to be happy by killing our own kinsmen?",
        "O Janardana, although these men, their hearts overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing one's family or quarreling with friends...",
        "why should we, who can see the crime in destroying a family, engage in these acts of sin?",
        "With the destruction of the dynasty, the eternal family tradition is vanquished, and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligion.",
        "When irreligion is prominent in the family, O Krishna, the women of the family become polluted, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Vrsni, comes unwanted progeny.",
        "An increase of unwanted population certainly causes hellish life for both the family and the destroyers of the family tradition. Deprived of sacrificial offerings, the ancestors of such corrupt families also fall.",
        "By the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted children, all kinds of community projects and family welfare activities are devastated.",
        "O Janardan (Krishna), I have heard from the learned that those who destroy family traditions dwell in hell for an indefinite period of time.",
        "Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts, driven by the desire to enjoy royal happiness.",
        "I would consider it better for the sons of Dhritarashtra to kill me unarmed and unresisting, rather than fight with them.",
        "Sanjay said: Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief."

    2: [
    "Sanjay said: Seeing Arjuna full of compassion and very sorrowful, his eyes brimming with tears, Madhusudan, Krsna, spoke the following words.",
    "The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the value of life. They lead not to higher abodes but to infamy.",
    "O Parth, it does not befit you to yield to this unmanliness. Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O vanquisher of enemies.",
    "Arjun said: O Madhusudan, how can I shoot arrows in battle on men like Bheeshma and Dronacharya, who are worthy of my worship, O destroyer of enemies?",
    "It would be better to live in this world by begging, than to enjoy life by killing these noble elders, who are my teachers. If we kill them, the wealth and pleasures we enjoy will be tainted with blood.",
    "We do not even know which result of this war is preferable for us—conquering them or being conquered by them. Even after killing them we will not desire to live. Yet they have taken the side of the sons of Dhritarasthra, and now stand before us on the battlefield.",
    "I am confused about my duty, and am besieged with anxiety and faintheartedness. I am Your disciple, and am surrendered to You. Please instruct me for certain what is best for me.",
    "I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses. I will not be able to dispel it even if I win a prosperous, unrivaled kingdom on earth with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven.",
    "Sanjay said: Having thus spoken, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told Krsna, Govinda, I shall not fight, and fell silent.",
    "O descendant of Bharata, at that time, Krsna, smiling in the midst of both armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.",
    "The Blessed Lord said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead.",
    "Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.",
    "As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, similarly the soul passes into another body at death. The wise are not bewildered by this.",
    "O son of Kunti, the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives rise to fleeting perceptions of happiness and distress. These are non-permanent, and come and go like the winter and summer seasons. One must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.",
    "O best among men [Arjuna], the person who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation.",
    "Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent there is no endurance, and of the existent there is no cessation. This seers have concluded by studying the nature of both.",
    "Know that which pervades the entire body is indestructible. No one is able to destroy the imperishable soul.",
    "Only the material body is perishable; the embodied soul within is indestructible, immeasurable, and eternal. Therefore, fight, O descendent of Bharat.",
    "Neither of them is in knowledge—the one who thinks the soul can slay and the one who thinks the soul can be slain. For truly, the soul neither kills nor can it be killed.",
    "The soul is neither born, nor does it ever die; nor having once existed, does it ever cease to be. The soul is without birth, eternal, immortal, and ageless. It is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.",
    "O Partha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?",
    "As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and worn-out ones.",
    "The soul can never be cut by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.",
    "This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried. It is everlasting, present everywhere, unchangeable, immovable, and eternally the same.",

    "One who is not disturbed in mind even amid the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.",
    "One who remains unattached under all conditions, and is neither delighted by good fortune nor dejected by tribulation, he is a sage with perfect knowledge.",
    "One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws its limbs within the shell, is firmly fixed in perfect consciousness.",
    "Aspirants may restrain the senses from their objects of enjoyment, but the taste for the sense objects remains. However, even this taste ceases for those who realizes the Supreme.",
    "The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is trying to control them.",
    "One who restrains his senses, keeping them under full control, and fixes his consciousness upon Me, is known as a man of perfect knowledge.",
    "While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment desire develops, and from desire anger arises.",
    "From anger, delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost, one is ruined.",
    "But one who controls the mind, and is free from attachment and aversion, even while using the objects of the senses, attains the Grace of God.",
    "By divine grace comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and the intellect of such a person of tranquil mind soon becomes firmly established in God.",
    "One who is not connected with the Supreme consciousness can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace?",
    "As a boat on the water is swept away by a strong wind, even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a person's intelligence.",
    "Therefore, O mighty-armed, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is certainly in transcendental knowledge.",
    "What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night of ignorance for the introspective sage.",
    "Just as the ocean remains undisturbed by the incessant flow of waters from rivers merging into it, likewise the sage who is unmoved despite the flow of desirable objects all around him attains peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy desires.",
    "A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego—he/she alone can attain real peace.",
    "That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God."
