        "Dhritarashtra said: O Sanjay, after gathering on the holy field of Kurukshetra, and desiring to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?",
        "Sanjay said: O King, after observing the Pandava army arrayed in military formation, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Drona and spoke the following words.",
        "Behold, O teacher, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by the son of Drupada, your wise disciple.",
        "Here in this army are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhima and Arjuna; great fighters like Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada.",
        "There are also great heroic, powerful fighters like Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, and the valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya.",
        "Yudhamanyu and the powerful Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi, all these warriors are great chariot fighters.",
        "But for your information, O best of the Brahmanas, let me tell you about the captains who are especially qualified to lead my military force.",
        "There are personalities like you, Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta called Bhurishrava, who are always victorious in battle.",
        "There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. All of them are well equipped with various kinds of weapons, and all are experienced in military science.",
        "Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bhishma, whereas the strength of the Pandavas, carefully protected by Bhima, is limited.",
        "All of you must now give full support to Grandfather Bhishma, as you stand at your respective strategic points of entrance into the phalanx of the army.",
        "Then Bhishma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly, making a sound like the roar of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy.",
        "After that, the conchshells, drums, bugles, trumpets, and horns were all suddenly sounded, and the combined sound was tumultuous.",
        "On the other side, both Lord Krishna and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.",
        "Lord Krishna blew His conchshell called Panchajanya, Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta, and Bhima, the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell called Paundra.",
        "King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conchshell, the Anantavijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosha and Manipushpaka.",
        "That great archer the King of Kashi, the great fighter Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the unconquerable Satyaki...",
        "Drupada, the sons of Draupadi, and the others, O King, such as the mighty-armed son of Subhadra, all blew their respective conchshells.",
        "The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious, vibrating both in the sky and on the earth. It shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra.",
        "At that time Arjuna, the son of Pandu, seated in the chariot bearing the flag marked with Hanuman, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows, looking at the sons of Dhritarashtra. O King, Arjuna then spoke to Hrishikesha (Krishna).",
        "Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies...",
        "so that I may see those present here, who desire to fight, and with whom I must contend in this great trial of arms.",
        "Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.",
        "Sanjay said: O descendant of Bharata, having thus been addressed by Arjuna, Lord Krishna drew the fine chariot up in the midst of the armies of both parties.",
        "In the presence of Bhishma, Drona, and all the other chieftains of the world, the Lord said, Just behold, Partha, all the Kurus assembled here.",
        "There Arjuna could see, within the midst of the armies of both parties, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends, and also his father-in-law and well-wishers.",
        "When the son of Kunti, Arjuna, saw all these different grades of friends and relatives, he became overwhelmed with compassion and spoke thus.",
        "Arjuna said: My dear Krishna, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up.",
        "My whole body is trembling, my hair is standing on end, my bow Gandiva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.",
        "I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I see only causes of misfortune, O Krishna, killer of the Kesi demon.",
        "I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle.",
        "Nor can I, my dear Krishna, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.",
        "O Govinda, of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness, or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield?",
        "O Madhusudana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me.",
        "Why should I wish to kill them, even though they might otherwise kill me? If we kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, what satisfaction will we derive from the dominion over the three worlds, what to speak of this Earth?",
        "O Maintainer of all living entities, what pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhritarasthra? Even though they may be aggressors, sin will certainly come upon us if we slay them.",
        "Hence, it does not behoove us to kill our own cousins, the sons of Dhritarashtra, and friends. O Madhav (Krishna), how can we hope to be happy by killing our own kinsmen?",
        "O Janardana, although these men, their hearts overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing one's family or quarreling with friends...",
        "why should we, who can see the crime in destroying a family, engage in these acts of sin?",
        "With the destruction of the dynasty, the eternal family tradition is vanquished, and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligion.",
        "When irreligion is prominent in the family, O Krishna, the women of the family become polluted, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Vrsni, comes unwanted progeny.",
        "An increase of unwanted population certainly causes hellish life for both the family and the destroyers of the family tradition. Deprived of sacrificial offerings, the ancestors of such corrupt families also fall.",

    "One who is not connected with the Supreme consciousness can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace?",
    "As a boat on the water is swept away by a strong wind, even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a person's intelligence.",

    "What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night of ignorance for the introspective sage.",
    "Just as the ocean remains undisturbed by the incessant flow of waters from rivers merging into it, likewise the sage who is unmoved despite the flow of desirable objects all around him attains peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy desires.",
    "A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego—he/she alone can attain real peace.",
    "That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God."
